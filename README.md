# ARShootingGame-DuoStick
My first AR Project - Test for Nexasoft company, a "Simple Multiplayer Twin Stick Shooting Game"

Hello everyone! This is Gem writing Summary. 
I'm always not that good at these things because I write for my own. 
This is my first AR project.
I want to point out,
This is my first experience using Netcode, AR, and consider first time using Unity New Input System (I mainly use sample in some courses and classes)

So everything in this project is a tiny little bit jangky as I was doing this project for learning, and submission, hope I can learn from a better places.
I have other assignment need to catch on, so I leave this project at here, as this project assumed can be run perfectly fine, and playable.
I might come back and patch thing up in the future, but I'm not sure when, or if I promises it.
Gem's out!
